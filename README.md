# Password-Cracking

Sills- 
Cryptography Basics, Password-Cracking


I just completed Goldman Sachs's Software Engineering on Forage. In the simulation I:

Completed a job simulation as a Goldman Sachs governance analyst responsible for assessing IT security and suggesting improvements.

Identified that the company was using an outdated password hashing algorithm by cracking passwords using Hashcat.

Wrote a memo for my supervisor summarizing a range of proposed uplifts to increase the companyâ€™s level of password protection including extending minimum password length and using a dedicated hashing algorithm.
